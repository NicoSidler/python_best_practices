## Research Agenda

Taking an exploratory approach, we aim to propose a simplified representation of the structure of the scientific field of astronomy and its evolution over time, based on Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of "[field](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champ_(sociology))" and "[habitus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_(sociology))". We will focus on the socio-demographic profiles and intellectual positions of the agents, as well as their organizational membership and the resulting networks of relationships between actors and organizations. We will also endeavor to propose a model of how this structure evolves over time. Furthermore, as part of a prosopographic approach, we will systematically collect data on the characteristics of the agents to highlight their biographical and activity profiles.

## Research questions
* Are there identifiable patterns in the continents of birth of sociologists born between 1950 and 1980, and how do these relate to gender?
* To what extent do sociologists remain within the same continent for their education, and how often do they follow transnational educational trajectories?
* Are there differences in educational mobility (domestic, transnational, multi-country) in relation to gender or birth cohort?
* How common are multi-country educational trajectories among sociologists born between 1950 and 1980?
* Does the number of education countries vary systematically by gender, birth cohort, or continent of birth?
* Are sociologists from certain continents of birth more likely to have studied in multiple countries than others?
* What structural patterns emerge from the relationship between continent of birth, educational mobility, and the number of education countries in the educational formation of sociologists?
* Can generational differences be observed in the extent of transnational educational mobility, suggesting changing patterns of academic internationalization over time?
