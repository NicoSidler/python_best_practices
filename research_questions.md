## Research Agenda

Taking an exploratory approach, we aim to propose a simplified representation of the structure of the scientific field of astronomy and its evolution over time, based on Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of "[field](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champ_(sociology))" and "[habitus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_(sociology))". We will focus on the socio-demographic profiles and intellectual positions of the agents, as well as their organizational membership and the resulting networks of relationships between actors and organizations. We will also endeavor to propose a model of how this structure evolves over time. Furthermore, as part of a prosopographic approach, we will systematically collect data on the characteristics of the agents to highlight their biographical and activity profiles.

## Research questions
* Are there identifiable patterns in the continents of birth of sociologists born between 1950 and 1980, and how do these relate to gender?
* Does the number of education countries vary systematically by gender among sociologists born between 1950 and 1980?
* Are sociologists from certain continents of birth more likely to have studied in more than one country than others?
* Can differences be observed between birth cohorts within the 1950–1980 period in the number of education countries associated with sociologists?
* What structural patterns emerge from the relationship between continent of birth, gender, and the number of education countries in the educational trajectories of sociologists?
* To what extent does the number of education countries suggest differing degrees of internationalization in the educational backgrounds of sociologists across cohorts or socio-demographic groups?
